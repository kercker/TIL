Today I learned that if color, such as red, green, blue, is a feature of one piece of data, 
we can also use real number to represent this feature.
Instead of one feature 'Color', we can create three binary features, such as isRed, isGreen, isBlue, 
whose values can only be 0(no) or 1(yes).
I have got a primary understanding of the "Mahalanobis distance" 
(http://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2012/02/15/what-is-mahalanobis-distance.html).
Today I also learned that sitecustomize.py is a script python will load at startup so long as it is
in the default path of python.
